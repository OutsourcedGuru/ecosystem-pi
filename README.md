# ecosystem-pi
A closed-system ecosystem managed with a Raspberry Pi 3 monitoring system.

## Why I Started This Project

I work at a pharmaceutical manufacturer and was dismayed when I heard about their "one and done" policy regarding some of the (expensive) glassware; after only one use in some cases, it is sent to landfill.  Since I'm into saving the planet, I thought I'd recycle some of this glassware. This is one of the projects related to that recycling.

Each new carboy costs from $300-$750 before shipping/taxes and I just snagged four of these from work before they made it to the dumpster. They're rugged, heavy, solidly-made and ready for this first project.

## Closed Ecosystem Aquarium
A closed ecosystem is one which doesn't require any maintenance or feeding from the owner. The entire ecosystem survives because it's in balanceâ€”the flora-to-fauna ratio is matched so that carbon dioxide produces by the animals matches the needs of the plants and vice versa with respect to the oxygen.

The animals feed from the plants and the plants get organic nutrients leftover by the animals. The plants convert carbon dioxide into oxygen using the power of light through photosynthesis.

## Raspberry Pi 3
Ultimately, I intend to dedicate a Raspberry Pi 3 single-board computer to monitor that delicate balance during the setup phase. It's important to monitor the carbon dioxide and nitrogen levels in order to confirm that the system can maintain itself.

I intend to first monitor and graph the carbon dioxide levels over time and use this to adjust the number of shrimp to be added to the ecosystem.

The next step then would be to use the Raspberry Pi 3 to monitor the changes in carbon dioxide to adjust the amount of time that light is added. The more light, the faster the plants produce oxygen. Too much oxygen results in algae. Too little oxygen results in the shrimp dying off.

### RhyzoMat
You'll need to buy a square of RhyzoMat for the base. the plants will send their roots down and anchor into it.

### Cut It Into a Circle
It doesn't have to be perfect, noting that we're only adding two plants into the system initially so anything close will do.

### Curl It, Push It Through the Top
You'll next need to tightly curl up the RhyzoMat so that it will fit through the approximately 3" inner diameter of the top. It will help if you have a dowel or bathroom curtain rod (or both) for the next step.

### Tamp It Down
Using something long enough, tamp down the RhyzoMat and if necessary, stretch it back out into a circle.

### Coathangers
You'll want to bend two coathangers as I've done so that they can be used later to hold down the plants just above the root area.

### Add Coathangers With Plants
Gently lower each coathanger and plant and guide them to one side. It helps to next put the carboy partially on a towel so that it's tilted and the substrate then will fall to the opposite side and not on the leaves.

### Add Six Cups of the Water From the Substrate
The substrate comes with about eight cups of water with the 20-lb bag. I'm using the [CaribSea Eco-Complete Planted Aquarium Substrate](https://www.caribsea.com/caribsea_ecoplanted.html).

### Add the Substrate Slowly
Add about eight cups of substrate slowly using a spoon. It helps to tilt the carboy so that the substrate falls to one side. Add a little, adjust the location of the plants, tilt the carboy differently and add more substrate until you've covered the bottom.

### Add Water
Move the carboy to its final location near sunlight but not in direct sunlight. It's important to get some sun but not too much. The intent is to later programmatically add just enough extra artificial light to keep everything in balance. So begin by finding a spot that can support a heavy carboy plus lots of water. It will be heavy after filling, about 40 pounds.

Add about three gallons of distilled water to bring the water level to the 4 gallon/15 liter mark on the graduated side of the carboy, noting that it has a 19-liter capacity in my case.

### Optional Step
I added a half-capful of [Seachem Flourish Excel](http://www.seachem.com/flourish-excel.php) which adds bioavailable carbon for the plants. This is probaly unnecessary, to be honest.

### Anchor Each Plant For a Week
Smooth out the substrate. You'll want to guide the plants back toward a spot somewhere in the middle of the RhyzoMat and then bend the coathangers so that they hold the plants at the surface level. We're hoping that the roots will grow down and latch into the RhyzoMat over the period of a few days.

Next, I prepared a square of clingwrap and just before covering everything I blew into the top of the carboy to add some carbon dioxide.

## Let Everything Sit For a Week
Give the plants a chance to root into the RhyzoMat so leave it in-place near a window that doesn't get too much direct sunlight.
